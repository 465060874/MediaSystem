Getting started
---------------
This program is currently under heavy development and as such getting it to run means you need to do some manual setting up.

1) First make sure you have all the requirements installed.

2) Create a database in PostgreSQL called 'mediasystem' with create rights.
   
3) Look at 'mediasystem-example.ini', make a copy of it in the root of the project and rename it 'mediasystem.ini'.  Edit it as needed.

4) Run the hs.mediasystem.MediaSystem class from Eclipse.
